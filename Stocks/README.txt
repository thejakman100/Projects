Disclaimer: This is still a basic code with a very little organization.
***********************************************************************
To run this program, you must have imported:
-bs4
-matplot
-urllib
-requests
-datetime
***********************************************************************
The Program MUST be started from stocks.py in order to work, which is why I have provided a shortcut to it called "RUN" which runs stocks.py, and it can be found in the root of this folder. And if you want to alter any code, all files can be found in the "Files" folder located in the root of this folder. All the .py files are also annoted so that you can understand the code better. Have fun!
***********************************************************************
Another Disclaimer: The API I used to create this program only allows the code to retrieve stock values only 5 times a minute and 500 times a day, so executing one search quickly after one another might return incorrect results and ultimatly break the code. I am currently working on a built in cool-down in the code, or I might even find a way to bypass the problem completely. The code still has a lot of problems, but they will be worked soon. Other features will be added as well.
